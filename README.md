# Yandrick_Grima_Project_2019

This project uses Node to power PArcel-Bundler, which in turn allows me to use SASS files.

to open this project you can:
*launch the index.html from the **dist** folder
*use Parcel-Bundler on your own machine

How to launch with Node and Parcel-Bundler
1. Install node from the [Node Wbesite](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run this command in your favourite terminal: **npm install -g parcel-bundler**
3. Open the project in terminal and run **parcel index.html**
